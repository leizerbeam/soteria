**What is Soteria?**
Soteria is a set of Cloud Native Data Protection Policies using open-source CNCF projects such as OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno.  In Greek mythology, Soteria is the goddess of safety and salvation, deliverance, and preservation from harm. Translated, Soteria aims to protect IT infrastructure and data from IT risks such as security incidents (ransomware), disasters (both natural and accidental), human error, and other incidents that would impact the availability of cloud native applications and services.

Soteria aims to implement the [WG-Policy Management Whitepaper](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/c61508a8651fcb49036188410becc36a3750217b/sig-security/policy/kubernetes-policy-management.md) for a data protection context.
